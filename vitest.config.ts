 * Absolute path inside a linked harness package.

 * The `.`/`./client` exports of the harness's browser packages are LOADER
 * BUNDLES — they open with `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({...})` and are meant
 * to be fetched by the shell, not imported by a test runner. Specs therefore
 * resolve those specifiers to the package's sources, exactly as the harness's
 * own vitest setup does through its tsconfig paths.
 *
 * This only works against a LOCAL harness (`pnpm run harness:local <path>`):
 * a published harness package ships `lib/` and `.d.ts` with no sources, which
 * is enough for `tsc` and not enough for these specs.
 * @param packageName - the linked harness package.
 * @param source - path of the entry module inside that package.
 * @returns the absolute source path.
